NAME
    GraphViz::ISA - Graphing @ISA hierarchies at run-time

SYNOPSIS
      use GraphViz::ISA;
      my $p = Some::Class->new;

      my $g1 = GraphViz::ISA->new($p);
      print $g1->as_png;

      my $g2 = GraphViz::ISA->new('Some::Other::Module');
      print $g2->as_png;

DESCRIPTION
    This class constructs a graph showing the `@ISA' hierarchy (note: not
    object hierarchies) from a package name or a blessed scalar.

METHODS
    The following methods are defined by this class; all other method calls
    are passed to the underlying GraphViz object:

    new()
        This constructs the object itself and takes a parameter. The
        parameter can be either a package name or a scalar blessed into a
        package. It then calls `isatree()' and hands the result to
        `graph()'. Then it returns the newly constructed object.

    isatree()
        Takes a package name as a parameter and traverses the indicated
        package's `@ISA' recursively, constructing a hash of hashes. If a
        package's `@ISA' is empty, it has an empty hashref as the value in
        the tree.

    graph()
        Takes a tree previously constructed by `isatree()' and traverses it,
        creating nodes and edges as it goes along.
