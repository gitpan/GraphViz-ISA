NAME
    GraphViz::ISA - Graphing class hierarchies at run-time

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
      use GraphViz::ISA;
      my $p = Some::Class->new;

      my $g1 = GraphViz::ISA->new($p);
      print $g1->as_png;

      my $g2 = GraphViz::ISA->new('Some::Other::Module');
      print $g2->as_png;

DESCRIPTION
    This class constructs a graph showing the @ISA hierarchy (note: not
    object hierarchies) from a package name or a blessed scalar.

    The methods described here are defined by this class; all other method
    calls are passed to the underlying GraphViz object:

METHODS
  new
    This constructs the object itself and takes a parameter. The parameter
    can be either a package name or a scalar blessed into a package. It then
    calls "isatree()" and hands the result to "graph()". Then it returns the
    newly constructed object.

  isatree
    Takes a package name as a parameter and traverses the indicated
    package's @ISA recursively, constructing a hash of hashes. If a
    package's @ISA is empty, it has an empty hashref as the value in the
    tree.

  graph
    Takes a tree previously constructed by "isatree()" and traverses it,
    creating nodes and edges as it goes along.

INSTALLATION
